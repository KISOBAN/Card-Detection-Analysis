How to detect the color
First: The picture of the card is blacked out so it doesn't interfere with the color detection. Only the colors outside of the picture is kept
Second: The image is converted from BGR to HSV (Hue Saturation Value)
Third: A mask is created using the cv.InRange() function call. These take in a color boundary parameter specified in HSV notation and returns all the pixels that correspond to that boundary in white pixels
Fourth: The mask is bitwise ANDED with the HSV image
Fifth: The resulting image from Step 4 is converted back to BGR as shown in the NormalcolorBoundary.png in this folder
